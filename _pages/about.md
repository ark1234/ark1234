I am currently a research assistant in [Medical FUSION Laboratory](https://wp.wpi.edu/medicalfusionlab/) and [Vision, Intelligence, and System Laboratory (VISLab)](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI). I am also a visiting scholar in [Yamada Lab](https://yamada-lab.gr.jp/en/index.html) at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/).


<!-- I am currently a research assistant in Robotic Engineering and Computer Engineering at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI).
I am a research assistant at [Robotic Materials Group](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/) at WPI under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz).
I have also worked as a research intern in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/).
 -->

My research areas lie in computer vision and machine learning, especially in deep learning, point cloud processing, medical data analysis, optimization, 2D/3D object detection/segmentation, person re-identification, satellite image process. 
<!-- My research focuses on the application of additive manufacturing technology to the fabrication of made-to-order robots.  -->
<!-- My recent works have been on employing computer vision and computer graphics technechnics to improve the manufacturing process. -->
